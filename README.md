# Introduction
First, we will be visualizing the data in time-series format, both as a whole and separate features. We will also be monitoring the high and low values, how they change over time and their comparisons. Secondly, we will be conducting statistical tests in order to understand the contribution of volume and close features, differences between different time frames, the fluctuations in the market on any given day and so on. Moreover, we are particularly interested in implementing machine learning algorithms that will predict the future of bitcoin. The predictions will vary: How a market fluctuates on a daily basis, if a particular day is a good day to purchase in a 30-day time frame, trends for a future span of 6 months etc.Throughout Bitcoin's rise, popularity and popular mentions have been crucial to its rise and fall. The most influential person in the Bitcoin market has been Elon Musk with his 81 million followers on Twitter. In addition to other features we want to make the market more predictable by working on Elon Musk's tweets and this impact on Bitcoin.

# Utilized Datasets
We work with additional datasets which are related directly with bitcoin fluctuation and Elon Musk's tweets.

Main Dataset


We add replies_count,retweet_date,retweets_count and video features for now from Elon Musks's tweets dataset, We are planning to develop it furthermore.
